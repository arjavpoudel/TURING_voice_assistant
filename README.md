# AI Voice Assistant 

<p>One of my old(er) projects from the archives lol. Voice Assistant activated via custom facial recognition program built using the opencv library. Model answering is based on GPT 3 DaVinci MK3.</p>

## Dependencies:

* pyttsx3 package
* pyaudio package
* openai package
* speechrecognition package
* numpy 
* opencv library 

## JS Integration
<p>The frontend_form.html file is a very simple form that accesses system microphone to display user query. The user can then submit this query which triggers an http post request, thus activating the chatbot logic to provide a verbal response.</p>
